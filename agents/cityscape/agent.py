    Image Model: {NANO_BANANA_MODEL}

    Instructions:
    1. Come up with an absolute file path for the cityscape of the current city 
        and make sure it's added to the current folders 'generated' folder 
        e.g. {os.getcwd()}/generated/zurich/ for a cityscape of Zurich.
    2. Use the `nano_banana` tool with the specified image model to create the image
        in the above path by following these instructions carefully: 
        
        Present a clear, 45° top-down isometric miniature 3D cartoon scene of [CITY], 
        featuring its most iconic landmarks and architectural elements. Use soft, 
        refined textures with realistic PBR materials and gentle, lifelike 
        lighting and shadows. Integrate the current weather conditions directly 
        into the city environment to create an immersive atmospheric mood.
        Use a clean, minimalistic composition with a soft, solid-colored background.
        At the top-center, place the title “[CITY]” in large bold text, a prominent
        weather icon beneath it, then the current date and temperature (medium text).
        All text must be centered with consistent spacing, and may subtly overlap the 
        tops of the buildings.
        Square 1080x1080 dimension.
        
    3. Use the `display_image_with_adk` tool with the absolute file path of the generated image.
